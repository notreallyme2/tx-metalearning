# Ideas for Tx meta-learning paper



Rather than learning a low-level representation, what about using INVASE (e.g. feature selection)

What about meta-learning (the main point of doing all this).  

The Pfizer paper used VAEs, AEs etc. Are new methods better (e.g. beta-VAEs)?  Can we disentangle bias?
